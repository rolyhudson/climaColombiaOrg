climaColombia was a project for the construction and dissemination of climatic data linked to the performance of buildings in Colombia.The project was born from the research "Climate driven building design and construction in the tropics; Tools and strategies to improve human comfort in Colombia" sponsored by the Royal Academy of Engineering, and developed by Universidad Piloto de Colombia and the University of Bath in collaboration with Lacunae ltd and Buro Happold, using data from the IDEAM.

This site includes three sections:"Tools" that contains online display engines for typical hourly data of major cities in the country, as well as monthly averages recorded and new ways to classify them according to comfort parameters. "Data" includes archives of typical years for the main cities of the country, generated from historical data obtained from the IDEAM, to be used within common environmental simulation engines. "Resources" provides links to academic publications are found on related topics.

With the aim of giving continuity and growth to the development carried out so far, the project will also involve the formation of a knowledge network with representatives of academic, professional and governmental entities, including IDEAM, SCA and local universities.
